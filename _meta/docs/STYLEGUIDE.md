# Styleguide (Short)
- Per-app isolation: own venv/node_modules, own .nvmrc and .python-version.
- Commits: Conventional Commits; each commit auto-writes CHANGES/<timestamp>.txt with file list.
- Tests under <project>/tests; API schemas in backend/app/schemas; UI components in frontend/src/components.
